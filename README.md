#### Entropy is a series of bits that is interpreted as an integer number to generate a private key.

This source will build entropy using mouse movement to guarantee randomization. <br />
Generating entropy by a method using a specified algorithm<ins> gives a risk </ins>to generating a computable private key. <br />
